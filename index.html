                        Computer Science and Music Technology</a>. I love programming and music
                    (I play violin and guitar), and though they seem like distant interests, I've

                    cooking and casual meal prepping, and my backup career (because everyone knows

                <h3>What I'm passionate about</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm really passionate about getting women and girls interested and involved
                    in Computer Science. I am a product of women-in-CS initiatives like
                    <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a> and an
                    <a href="https://www.marlbots3526.org/" target="_blank">all-girl robotics
                        team</a>. I believe that in order for any team to achieve their best results,
                    they need diverse ideas and solutions, which means you need a diverse team!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also passionate about sustainability! As humans, we are stewards
                    to the Earth and are called to take care of it! I try to do my part by
                    <a href="https://www.wwf.org.au/news/blogs/10-worst-single-use-plastics-and-eco-friendly-alternatives#gs.btk9vo"
                       target="_blank">
                        replacing single-use items</a> in my daily life and buying products with
                    minimal to no packaging as well as by supporting companies with sustainable
                    practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also think it's really important that young people learn
                    <a href="https://www.takechargeamerica.org/7-essential-financial-skills-for-young-adults/"
                       target="_blank">
                        financial literacy</a>, from managing a bank account and budgeting to
                    how the stock market works and how to manage debt. Living on your own and
                    learning how to "adult" is hard, but knowing how to manage
                    your finances makes it a little easier.

                    outside application with an in-house one. I conducted behavioral interviews

                    I'm currently a student at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/"

                        Computer Science and Music Technology</a>. I love programming and music
                    (I play violin and guitar), and though they seem like distant interests, I've
                    found that they have quite a lot in common! They both need a great team to

                    cooking and casual meal prepping, and my backup career (because everyone knows

                <h3>What I'm passionate about</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm really passionate about getting women and girls interested and involved
                    in Computer Science. I am a product of women-in-CS initiatives like
                    <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a> and an
                    <a href="https://www.marlbots3526.org/" target="_blank">all-girl robotics
                        team</a>. I believe that in order for any team to achieve their best results,
                    they need diverse ideas and solutions, which means they need a diverse team!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also passionate about sustainability! As humans, we are stewards
                    to the Earth and are called to take care of it! I try to do my part by
                    <a href="https://www.wwf.org.au/news/blogs/10-worst-single-use-plastics-and-eco-friendly-alternatives#gs.btk9vo"
                       target="_blank">
                        replacing single-use items</a> in my daily life, buying products with
                    minimal to no packaging, and eating vegetarian/vegan when I can, as well as by
                    supporting companies with sustainable practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also think it's really important that young people learn
                    <a href="https://www.takechargeamerica.org/7-essential-financial-skills-for-young-adults/"
                       target="_blank">
                        financial literacy</a>, from managing a bank account and budgeting to
                    how the stock market works and how to manage debt. Living on your own and
                    learning how to "adult" is hard, but knowing how to manage
                    your finances makes it a little easier.

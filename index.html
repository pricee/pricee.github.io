                    <h2>Hi I'm Emma!</h2>
                    <p>Thanks for stopping by! </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm currently a student at Northeastern University, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and
                        Music Technology. I love programming and music (I play violin and guitar), and
                        though they seem like distant interests, I've found that they have quite a lot
                        in common! They both need a great team to succeed, require creative
                        problem-solving, and are full of cool, smart, and fun people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also love cats, hiking, and
                        <a href="https://stitchedmodern.com/blogs/news/a-beginners-guide-to-cross-stitch" target="_blank">cross-stitch</a>!
                        I dream of living the
                        <a href="https://trailandsummit.com/what-is-vanlife/" target="_blank">#vanlife</a>,
                        but know that I probably would get too cooped up living in a van. I enjoy cooking and casual
                        meal prepping, and my backup career (because everyone knows Software Developers need
                        backup careers!) is to become a bee keeper, despite the fact that I've never
                        actually been near a bee-hive...

                    <h3>What I'm passionate about</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm really passionate about getting women interested and involved in Computer Science.
                        I am a product of some of the first women-in-CS initiatives like
                        <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a> and
                        <a href="https://www.marlbots3526.org/" target="_blank">all-girl robotics teams</a>.
                        I think that in order for a team to achieve their
                        best results, they need diverse ideas and solutions, which means you need a diverse team!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm also really passionate about sustainability! As humans, we are stewards
                        to the Earth and are called to take care of it! I try to do my part by
                        <a href="https://www.wwf.org.au/news/blogs/10-worst-single-use-plastics-and-eco-friendly-alternatives#gs.btk9vo" target="_blank">
                            replacing single-use items</a> in my daily life and buying products with minimal
                        to no packaging as well as by supporting companies with sustainable practices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also think it's really important that young people learn
                        <a href="https://www.takechargeamerica.org/7-essential-financial-skills-for-young-adults/" target="_blank">
                            financial literacy</a>, from managing a bank account and budgeting to
                        how the stock market works and how to manage debt. Living on your own and
                        learning how to "adult" is hard, but knowing how to manage
                        your finances makes it a little easier.

                    <h4>Northeastern University Women in Technology - Vice President</h4>
                    <p class="descriptionForHeader">
                        As VP, I'm in charge of making sure our Executive Board meets NUWIT's goals by
                        planning logistics and events with external companies, University organizations,
                        and University administration. I manage our Executive Board officers and
                        coordinate between them to make sure tasks get done in a timely manner. I serve
                        as a spokesperson for NUWIT while interacting with stakeholders, including
                        University staff and faculty, alumnae advisors, and potential donors. Additionally,
                        during COVID-19, I adapted NUWIT to distance learning and virtual meetings.
